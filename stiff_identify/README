This folder contains scripts to process the rosbags obtained from hip identification experiments

#### Unbagger.py ####

* It is a class to read ros bags and cast the required data into pandas frames. 


#### Identification_tools.py ####

* This script contains a use example that will be executed if it is run.
The example starts at the line 629.

* It is important to specify the interval of time where the experiment happends.
It can be specified in the lists `LT_range` and `RT_range`.
In order to see what is the range of times that should be used, run `check_time_stiffness(<data frame>)` 
this will produce a plot where the starting and endding times can be observed.


* It is also possible to discart certain values of stiffness.
This can be specified using the lists `rm_LK` and `rm_RK` which are set to None by default.

* For more options check the atributs of the funtion `identify`. 


#### map_stiffness ####

* Is a script to execute the identification tools directly from the bash with the bag file names as arguments.


#### FirstPasses ####

* Functions to correct and clean data for the first pass of the identification.
Use examples are included, but they wont run directly as the bags are missing.
